# Zippers

A quick PureScript version of [this Elm package](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Guid75/ziplist/latest), but with a few typeclass instances for reasons.

This is really a simple learning expirment, so please open an [issue](https://github.com/thunklife/purescript-zipper/issues) if something could be improved.
